# 18F Auction Notifier

18F, a branch of the US Digital Service, launched a ["micropurchasing"](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/13/open-source-micropurchasing/) experiment last year,
allowing interested developers to bid on small software engineering jobs via reverse auctions starting at $3,500.

This app's job is to ensure that a user is always notified when new auctions appear on the site. It uses the Micropurchasing platform's
[API](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/api) and requires a Github Personal API token. See the API documentation for more details.
